# Leveraging HAL and JSON:API Standards for Hypermedia APIs in Node.js
As a dedicated API architect with a strong focus on designing maintainable and discoverable services, I am constantly challenging myself to acquire new techniques and knowledge. A recent project undertaken at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/) led me far beyond my usual scope of work - the creation of a hypermedia-driven Node.js API from the ground up.

I set for myself an ambitious yet practical objective: to fully implement the HATEOAS style in accordance with the HAL and JSON:API specifications, meticulously testing every step of the way. This endeavor allowed me to gain hands-on experience in applying emerging web standards within a real-world context.

Over the course of six months, I painstakingly developed a comprehensive order management system that delivered responses in the form of hyperlinked state representations. The process of evaluating how each specification structured relationships between order, product, and customer resources brought to light important distinctions in their respective approaches.

This article serves as a platform for discussing the key insights derived from this experience. Within, you will find code samples that elucidate the intricacies of modeling interconnected resources. My ultimate goal is to share the knowledge gained during this journey with fellow API designers who are exploring the realm of RESTful architecture design.

It is through continuous challenges like these that I expand my expertise in crafting elegant yet robust APIs. My unwavering commitment to learning serves both my personal development and my ability to deliver sophisticated solutions to clients.

### Demystifying HATEOAS
HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) is a defining paradigm for RESTful design. It champions the idea that hypermedia should guide clients through an API. Unlike traditional APIs that require prior knowledge of endpoints and relationships, HATEOAS APIs embed necessary instructions directly within their responses.

By including hyperlinks within data payloads, HATEOAS-compliant APIs empower clients to dynamically discover valid next interactions. These links act as guides, instructing clients on where to navigate after each request, eliminating the need for predefined sequences. For example, when retrieving an order resource, clients may discover links to associated products, customers, or invoices.

This approach allows clients the flexibility to traverse resources dynamically, as opposed to being restricted by static endpoint configurations. As the API structure evolves with the introduction of new entities or relations, existing clients can seamlessly adapt by following hypermedia prompts.

Embracing HATEOAS effectively disconnects client implementations from the intricacies of resource interconnections within the API. Well-designed HATEOAS interfaces ensure that responses naturally drive further engagement by providing clear affordances.

Modifications such as enriching payloads with additional links are effortlessly propagated to all clients. Over time, APIs following this style naturally cultivate discoverability, resilience, and independence from preconceived notions about their domain model. All of this is achieved through the utilization of linked data as the governing engine of client-server dialogues.

### Advantages of HATEOAS
By building upon hypermedia as the primary driver of self-description, HATEOAS-style REST APIs offer several notable advantages:

**1. Self-Documenting Interactions**: Each response implicitly outlines its interactive context through embedded links, negating the need for separate specification artifacts.

**2. Fluid Evolution**: The API remains decoupled from clients and can organically expand by introducing new relations or refactoring endpoints over time.

**3. Resilience to Change**: Structural changes to the domain model are transparently accommodated, as all clients simply follow updated links.

**4. Progressive Exposure**: Hypermedia responses enable the gradual unveiling of expanded functionality post-release, following an inside-out development mindset.

**5. Exploratory Interfaces**: Clients can discover previously overlooked interactions by dynamically traversing relational prompts within responses.

**6. Adaptive Navigation**: HATEOAS liberates clients to reactively prioritize resource flows tailored to their contextual needs with each request.

Fundamentally, the hypermedia-driven design of REST interfaces embodies properties such as evolution, teaching, long-term viability, and flexibility. These properties are upheld through responses that guide their own exploration and progress over time.

## Selecting a Hypermedia Approach
When implementing HATEOAS in a Node.js API, two commonly used specifications come to the forefront: Hypertext Application Language (HAL) and JSON:API.

### HAL
The HAL specification defines a simple format that employs a top-level "_links" property to represent relationships between resources.

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/orders/1" },
    "items": { "href": "/orders/1/items"} 
  }
}
```

HAL is known for its lightweight nature, intuitive design, and its ability to meet basic hypermedia needs.

### JSON:API
JSON:API, on the other hand, establishes a comprehensive JSON API standard. It explicitly connects resources through a "relationships" object that contains related IDs and links.

```
"relationships": {
  "items": {
    "links": {
      "related": "/orders/1/relationships/items"  
    },
    "data": [...ids]
  }
}
```

While JSON:API offers a richer hypermedia format, it does come with a more complex implementation compared to HAL.

### Choosing the Right Approach
For simpler use cases, HAL often suffices due to its minimal overhead. JSON:API, on the other hand, is better suited for more robust APIs, thanks to its comprehensive specification framework. The choice between the two largely depends on the specific hypermedia needs and the overall design of the API. Both HAL and JSON:API enable the principles of HATEOAS.

## Developing a Node.js API with Hypermedia Links
In this guide, I will walk you through the process of building a RESTful API that implements the Hypertext Application Language (HAL) specification using Express.

### Integrating Essential Modules
To generate HAL-compliant representations of resources and their relationships, we will make use of the `express-hal-builder` library.

```
npm install express-hal-builder
```

### Defining Application Resources
We start by defining schemas for the Order and OrderItem using JavaScript object structures.

```js
const Order = {};
const OrderItem = {};
```

### Creating Hypermedia Representations
The HAL builder will be our tool for mapping entities to hypermedia. This includes:

1. Representing a resource entity.

2. Embedding links to associated child resources.

```js
app.get('/orders/:id', (req, res) => {

  const order = //...

  const builder = new HalBuilder();

  builder.representEntity(order)
    .childLink(order.items, '/orders/'+id+'/items');

  res.json(builder.get());

});
```

This framework provides the foundation for developing a REST API that adheres to HAL specifications by rendering resources and their relationships through hypermedia links.

## Navigating Resources in a HAL API
Discovering resources and navigating between linked entities in a HAL API involves the following steps:

- Initiate initial GET requests to reveal starting points.
- Parse responses to identify relation types.
- Traverse connections by following URIs provided in "_links."
- Gradually unveil the data model through exploration.

## Constructing a Linked API with JSON:API
In this guide, we will explore how to develop a RESTful backend that adheres to the JSON:API standard and represents relationships between resources using Express.

### Adding Necessary Dependencies
The `jsonapi-serializer` module proves invaluable

 in generating standardized responses.

### Defining Core Entity Types
Schemas are used to define the structure of essential resources, such as Order and Item.

### Creating JSON:API Documents
Responses establish data relationships across entities by:

1. Serializing a parent resource.

2. Including references to associated children.

```js
app.get('/orders/:id', async (req, res) => {

  const order = await Order.findById(req.id);

  res.json(order.serialize({
    include: 'items'  
  }));

});
```

This sets the stage for a compliant JSON:API implementation that connects resources through standardized linkage.

## In Conclusion
To summarize, adhering to established API specifications brings structure, discoverability, and future-proofing to applications in the face of changing demands. Conforming to standards ensures that services remain intuitive.
